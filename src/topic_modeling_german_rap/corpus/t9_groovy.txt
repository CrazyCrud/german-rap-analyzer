( Intro )
Aye , aye , what y’all know bout this old school man ?
It’s T9

(Verse)
I said let’s do it , we can get into it
She hate when it be quiet she told me to cut on music
And we get groovy , laid up ,hand on yo booty
And imma beat it up , and show yo ex just how to do it
Call me young Aj cause we can do it in a Buick
I’m rubbing on yo clit, while I’m in it  and watch you lose it
Like slow it down , she tell me slow it down
We in here for a while , I’m trynna go a couple rounds
Hand over yo mouth cause i don’t wanna hear a sound
We been texting all day , when i get home it’s going down
And imma real stepper , make you stutter when you talking
Her legs feeling weak so now she limping when she walking
I got her where i want her so now she wetter than a faucet
And her toes curling up when I’m kissing on her body like

(Chorus)
I can’t get over you cause you 
Get up and cook like i told you to
And i fuck you just like I’m posed to do
And i , I get this feeling when I’m touching you


(Verse)
Aye , and you know just what it is
Fuck yo guts , i want you to feel me all in yo ribs
Just focus on me ,and you can tell me how you feel
I’m pulling on yo hair while I’m in it , it give you chills
And imma fuck you like we ain’t link inna couple years
You running from the pressure , i pull you back like come here
Just feel the motion , and i cover you up with lotion
Don’t take yo golds out , i want you to try it with yo golds in like

(Chorus)
I can’t get over you cause you 
Get up and cook like i told you to
And i , fuck you just like I’m posed to do
And i , I get this feeling when I’m touching you

(Outro)
Aye when I’m touching you 
Aye I get this feeling when I’m touching you
And touching you , and it’s T9 (yeah , yeah )
